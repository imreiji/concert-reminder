# WISHLIST.md

Every potential feature raised in roadmap and UX discussions, ordered by
user impact (highest first). Maintained per the "Feature wishlist" section
in CLAUDE.md: fully re-evaluated and re-ranked every time a feature ships.
Each entry notes impact and effort so re-ranking has a basis. Shipped and
rejected ideas move to the bottom sections instead of being deleted.

## Proposed (highest impact first)

(none currently — first-run guided setup, the last remaining entry,
shipped alongside per-round lottery outcome tracking; next feature idea
starts a fresh section after this header)

## Shipped

### First-run guided setup (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a `/welcome` wizard route that sequences new logins through
tag subscriptions (follow artists), default reminder preset selection,
timezone confirmation, a test DM to verify delivery, and calendar feed
subscription. Backed by an `onboarding_step` column on `User` to track
progress, a new-user redirect in the OAuth callback, and a `next`
redirect parameter added to the five existing routes the wizard reuses
(concerts, presets, tags, preferences, calendar) to stitch them together
into one seamless flow.

### Per-round personal lottery outcome tracking (applied / won / lost / paid) (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: state-aware DM buttons (Applied/Not applied, Won/Lost, Paid)
on the reminder embed, backed by a new `RoundOutcome` table and
`record_round_outcome`/`_apply_outcome_suppression` in `db/service.py` —
losing suppresses that round's payment reminder and arms the next
round's opens reminder; winning skips the general-sale ping. Also
generalized `snooze_reminder` to accept a `days` parameter and added a
"Remind me later" modal-driven button (replacing the plain 24h snooze)
on the CLOSES-anchor reminder specifically, plus relabeled that anchor's
link button to "Apply here".

### Free-text search matches artists, groups, and venues (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a centralized `concert_search_text` helper (`web/app.py`) that
is now the single source of truth for what search matches — title,
title_en, every attached tag's name across all four kinds
(franchise/group/artist/venue), and a free-text `Concert.venue` fallback
only when no VENUE tag is attached. Used at all three call sites: the
server-side `matches_query` fallback, the tile grid's `data-search`
attribute, and the "Coming up soon" deadline list's `data-search`
attribute (previously title-only).

### Surface undeliverable DMs to the user (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a sitewide `dm_blocked` banner (driven by `SessionUser` /
`users.dm_blocked_since`, set by the scheduler's delivery-outcome
tracking) plus a synchronous `POST /me/test-dm` diagnostic route and
"Send test DM" button on the preferences page.

## Rejected

### Daily digest mode (rejected 2026-07-18)

Was: an opt-in "one morning DM listing everything due" to reduce
per-deadline ping fatigue for multi-subscription users. Rejected by the
owner during design review — not worth the scheduling complexity it
would have needed (a per-user local-morning gate layered onto
`due_reminders()`/`tick()`) for a noise problem the owner doesn't
consider significant enough to solve right now.
