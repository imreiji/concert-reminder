# WISHLIST.md

Every potential feature raised in roadmap and UX discussions, ordered by
user impact (highest first). Maintained per the "Feature wishlist" section
in CLAUDE.md: fully re-evaluated and re-ranked every time a feature ships.
Each entry notes impact and effort so re-ranking has a basis. Shipped and
rejected ideas move to the bottom sections instead of being deleted.

## Proposed (highest impact first)

### 1. Real per-concert tracking (ConcertSubscription)

Impact: high - effort: medium. Raised: 2026-07-19 (Home/Discover split,
branch review).

"Tracked" is currently derived at query time: a concert is tracked if it
carries any tag the user has a TagSubscription for
(`service.tracked_concert_ids`, which says so in its own docstring). That
was always the interim definition, and shipping Home promoted it from an
implementation detail to the thing that decides what the whole front page
shows. It has no opt-out, so following one artist tag drags in every
concert that artist touches, and no opt-in, so a concert you care about but
whose tags you do not follow can never reach the board. The
`OPEN_COLUMN_LIMIT` cap on the board's open column is the only thing making
an over-broad match tolerable today. Wants a real `ConcertSubscription`
table plus a per-leg opt-out, replacing that function's body wholesale -
deliberately not half-built earlier, since a partial version would have to
be migrated.

Ranked first now because Home made it load-bearing; before the split it was
one input to a catalogue page among several.

### 2. Minute-level reminder offsets

Impact: medium (raised from low) - effort: small. Raised: 2026-07-18
(domain-model review discussion). Re-ranked 2026-07-19.

`ReminderRule`/`PresetItem` already support `offset_days` + `offset_hours`
(0-23); there's no `offset_minutes`. The 60s scheduler tick already
delivers at ~1-minute granularity, so the gap is purely the data model +
form UI, not scheduling precision.

Re-ranked up because the condition the owner attached to it has now
fired: the entry said "revisit if/when FCFS-style rounds get their own
flag", and `RoundKind.FCFS_SALE` shipped on 2026-07-18. First-come-
first-served sales are exactly the case where "remind me 5 minutes before
it opens" beats "remind me 3 hours before", so this is no longer
speculative - it just has no user complaints behind it yet.

### 3. Collapse a round's multiple "Coming up" rows into one

Impact: medium - effort: medium. Raised: 2026-07-19 (Home/Discover split,
branch review).

`upcoming_deadlines` emits one row per future anchor, so a single round
with opens/closes/results/payment ahead of it takes up to four of Home's
ten "Coming up" slots, all naming the same round. The correctness half of
this (each of those rows offering its own independent capture buttons,
including on a round nobody could have entered yet) was fixed on
2026-07-19 by gating capture on `DeadlineRow.can_capture`; what remains is
purely the row budget. Deferred rather than done because collapsing
changes the shape of the fragment that `POST /rounds/{id}/outcome` swaps
back in via htmx, and the no-buttons gate already removed the harm.

### 4. Let a user record won/lost on a round with nothing left ahead of it

Impact: low - effort: small. Raised: 2026-07-19 (Home/Discover split,
branch review).

Capture lives on "Coming up" rows, and a row exists only while the round
has at least one FUTURE anchor. So a round whose results have passed and
which carries no payment deadline drops off Home entirely, and a user
sitting on APPLIED for it has no web-side way to say how it went - the
card stays in the Applied column. The 2026-07-19 fix (offering "I won" /
"I lost" once the result moment arrives) covers every round that still has
something ahead of it, which is the common shape; this is the tail. Wants
either a capture surface on the concert page itself or a short grace
window that keeps a just-resolved round on the list.

## Shipped

### Home and Discover split (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: the old combined index page cut in two by the question each
answers. `/` (`templates/home.html`, handler in `web/app.py`) is Home -
personal, login-gated, four blocks: Up next, the four-column campaign board
(`domain/board.py`'s `column_for` plus `service.board_cards`), Coming up
(`service.my_deadline_rows`, the page's only capture surface), and a teaser
out to Discover. `/discover` (`web/routes/discover.py` +
`templates/discover.html`) is the catalogue - and is public, the only
content page an anonymous visitor can reach - with a round-status facet, a
next-deadline sort, and one merged status pill per card
(`service.discover_statuses`). Capture actions post to
`web/routes/outcomes.py`, which shares `record_round_outcome` with the DM
buttons and swaps three fragments back (the rows, plus the board and its
tally out-of-band).

Branch review on 2026-07-19 then fixed six things before merge: the top
block claimed "Closes next" while showing an open (now "Up next", honest
about which moment it names); every future anchor of one round offered its
own capture buttons, so a user could record APPLIED against a round that
had not opened (now gated on `can_capture`); WON and LOST existed only as
Discord buttons, leaving a `dm_blocked` user or a `bot_enabled=False`
deploy with a four-column board the web could only drive two columns of
(now offered on an APPLIED row once its result moment lands); the teaser
counted every Concert row rather than what `/discover` lists;
`tracked_concert_ids` ran twice per render; and the docs were behind.

### Public terms of service page (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: `GET /terms`, the counterpart to `/privacy` — same shape
(`web/routes/terms.py` + `templates/terms.html`, `current_user` not
`require_user` so Discord's reviewers can read it signed out), filling the
Terms of Service URL field the Developer Portal offers alongside the
Privacy Policy URL. The clause that actually matters is the disclaimer of
warranty: the service tracks real ticketing deadlines and cannot promise a
DM arrives, arrives on time, or that the date is right, so it says so
plainly and puts confirmation with the official source on the user. Also
covers non-affiliation (the app is entirely about other people's events),
Discord's own minimum age rather than a number, acceptable use, editor
contributions staying in the shared catalogue after erasure (matching the
privacy policy and `delete_user`), availability/shutdown, and New Brunswick
governing law. Contacts reuse the existing `PRIVACY_CONTACT_*` settings via
a new shared `web/contact.py`; the two pages cross-link.

### Public privacy policy page (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: `GET /privacy`, a public (deliberately no `require_user`)
long-form policy page in `web/routes/privacy.py` + `templates/privacy.html`,
linked from the `base.html` footer. Required by Discord's Developer Terms
for any app collecting user data, and mandatory at bot verification /
100+ guilds; also covers the GDPR transparency obligation. Content is
written against the actual schema rather than boilerplate, and documents
the erasure semantics the `1384cadd692e` migration enables (personal data
deleted, contributed catalogue kept with the author anonymised). The
operator's contact handle and email come from two new blank-by-default
settings (`PRIVACY_CONTACT_DISCORD` / `PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL`) so real
contact details never enter the repo; the page renders with both, one, or
neither configured.

### First-run guided setup (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a `/welcome` wizard route that sequences new logins through
tag subscriptions (follow artists), default reminder preset selection,
timezone confirmation, a test DM to verify delivery, and calendar feed
subscription. Backed by an `onboarding_step` column on `User` to track
progress, a new-user redirect in the OAuth callback, and a `next`
redirect parameter added to the five existing routes the wizard reuses
(concerts, presets, tags, preferences, calendar) to stitch them together
into one seamless flow.

### Corrected and expanded round-kind taxonomy (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: two new `RoundKind` enum values, `FCFS_SALE` and `TOUR_PACKAGE`,
splitting out first-come-first-served sales from the previously-conflated
general-sale kind and adding support for overseas tour package sales. A
centralized `LABEL_BY_ROUND_KIND` dict in `db/service.py` now provides
display labels for all nine kinds (replacing six inline label derivations
scattered across templates), with corrected emoji assignments (removing
the racing emoji misapplied to `GENERAL_SALE`, adding the appropriate
emoji for the two new kinds). Also updated `ingest.py`'s ramen.events
keyword table to recognize FCFS and tour-package keywords in HTML parsing.

### Per-round personal lottery outcome tracking (applied / won / lost / paid) (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: state-aware DM buttons (Applied/Not applied, Won/Lost, Paid)
on the reminder embed, backed by a new `RoundOutcome` table and
`record_round_outcome`/`_apply_outcome_suppression` in `db/service.py` —
losing suppresses that round's payment reminder and arms the next
round's opens reminder; winning skips the general-sale ping. Also
generalized `snooze_reminder` to accept a `days` parameter and added a
"Remind me later" modal-driven button (replacing the plain 24h snooze)
on the CLOSES-anchor reminder specifically, plus relabeled that anchor's
link button to "Apply here".

### Free-text search matches artists, groups, and venues (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a centralized `concert_search_text` helper (`web/app.py`) that
is now the single source of truth for what search matches — title,
title_en, every attached tag's name across all four kinds
(franchise/group/artist/venue), and a free-text `Concert.venue` fallback
only when no VENUE tag is attached. Used at all three call sites: the
server-side `matches_query` fallback, the tile grid's `data-search`
attribute, and the "Coming up soon" deadline list's `data-search`
attribute (previously title-only).

### Surface undeliverable DMs to the user (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a sitewide `dm_blocked` banner (driven by `SessionUser` /
`users.dm_blocked_since`, set by the scheduler's delivery-outcome
tracking) plus a synchronous `POST /me/test-dm` diagnostic route and
"Send test DM" button on the preferences page.

## Rejected

### Daily digest mode (rejected 2026-07-18)

Was: an opt-in "one morning DM listing everything due" to reduce
per-deadline ping fatigue for multi-subscription users. Rejected by the
owner during design review — not worth the scheduling complexity it
would have needed (a per-user local-morning gate layered onto
`due_reminders()`/`tick()`) for a noise problem the owner doesn't
consider significant enough to solve right now.
