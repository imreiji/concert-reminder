# WISHLIST.md

Every potential feature raised in roadmap and UX discussions, ordered by
user impact (highest first). Maintained per the "Feature wishlist" section
in CLAUDE.md: fully re-evaluated and re-ranked every time a feature ships.
Each entry notes impact and effort so re-ranking has a basis. Shipped and
rejected ideas move to the bottom sections instead of being deleted.

## Proposed (highest impact first)

### 1. Minute-level reminder offsets

Impact: low today — effort: small. Raised: 2026-07-18 (domain-model
review discussion).

`ReminderRule`/`PresetItem` already support `offset_days` + `offset_hours`
(0-23); there's no `offset_minutes`. The 60s scheduler tick already
delivers at ~1-minute granularity, so the gap is purely the data model +
form UI, not scheduling precision. Not worth building yet — the owner's
read is that this only starts to matter once a first-come-first-served
round type exists, where users might genuinely want "remind me 5 minutes
before sale opens" instead of hours. Revisit if/when FCFS-style rounds
get their own flag or handling.

## Shipped

### Public terms of service page (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: `GET /terms`, the counterpart to `/privacy` — same shape
(`web/routes/terms.py` + `templates/terms.html`, `current_user` not
`require_user` so Discord's reviewers can read it signed out), filling the
Terms of Service URL field the Developer Portal offers alongside the
Privacy Policy URL. The clause that actually matters is the disclaimer of
warranty: the service tracks real ticketing deadlines and cannot promise a
DM arrives, arrives on time, or that the date is right, so it says so
plainly and puts confirmation with the official source on the user. Also
covers non-affiliation (the app is entirely about other people's events),
Discord's own minimum age rather than a number, acceptable use, editor
contributions staying in the shared catalogue after erasure (matching the
privacy policy and `delete_user`), availability/shutdown, and New Brunswick
governing law. Contacts reuse the existing `PRIVACY_CONTACT_*` settings via
a new shared `web/contact.py`; the two pages cross-link.

### Public privacy policy page (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: `GET /privacy`, a public (deliberately no `require_user`)
long-form policy page in `web/routes/privacy.py` + `templates/privacy.html`,
linked from the `base.html` footer. Required by Discord's Developer Terms
for any app collecting user data, and mandatory at bot verification /
100+ guilds; also covers the GDPR transparency obligation. Content is
written against the actual schema rather than boilerplate, and documents
the erasure semantics the `1384cadd692e` migration enables (personal data
deleted, contributed catalogue kept with the author anonymised). The
operator's contact handle and email come from two new blank-by-default
settings (`PRIVACY_CONTACT_DISCORD` / `PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL`) so real
contact details never enter the repo; the page renders with both, one, or
neither configured.

### First-run guided setup (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a `/welcome` wizard route that sequences new logins through
tag subscriptions (follow artists), default reminder preset selection,
timezone confirmation, a test DM to verify delivery, and calendar feed
subscription. Backed by an `onboarding_step` column on `User` to track
progress, a new-user redirect in the OAuth callback, and a `next`
redirect parameter added to the five existing routes the wizard reuses
(concerts, presets, tags, preferences, calendar) to stitch them together
into one seamless flow.

### Corrected and expanded round-kind taxonomy (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: two new `RoundKind` enum values, `FCFS_SALE` and `TOUR_PACKAGE`,
splitting out first-come-first-served sales from the previously-conflated
general-sale kind and adding support for overseas tour package sales. A
centralized `LABEL_BY_ROUND_KIND` dict in `db/service.py` now provides
display labels for all nine kinds (replacing six inline label derivations
scattered across templates), with corrected emoji assignments (removing
the racing emoji misapplied to `GENERAL_SALE`, adding the appropriate
emoji for the two new kinds). Also updated `ingest.py`'s ramen.events
keyword table to recognize FCFS and tour-package keywords in HTML parsing.

### Per-round personal lottery outcome tracking (applied / won / lost / paid) (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: state-aware DM buttons (Applied/Not applied, Won/Lost, Paid)
on the reminder embed, backed by a new `RoundOutcome` table and
`record_round_outcome`/`_apply_outcome_suppression` in `db/service.py` —
losing suppresses that round's payment reminder and arms the next
round's opens reminder; winning skips the general-sale ping. Also
generalized `snooze_reminder` to accept a `days` parameter and added a
"Remind me later" modal-driven button (replacing the plain 24h snooze)
on the CLOSES-anchor reminder specifically, plus relabeled that anchor's
link button to "Apply here".

### Free-text search matches artists, groups, and venues (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a centralized `concert_search_text` helper (`web/app.py`) that
is now the single source of truth for what search matches — title,
title_en, every attached tag's name across all four kinds
(franchise/group/artist/venue), and a free-text `Concert.venue` fallback
only when no VENUE tag is attached. Used at all three call sites: the
server-side `matches_query` fallback, the tile grid's `data-search`
attribute, and the "Coming up soon" deadline list's `data-search`
attribute (previously title-only).

### Surface undeliverable DMs to the user (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a sitewide `dm_blocked` banner (driven by `SessionUser` /
`users.dm_blocked_since`, set by the scheduler's delivery-outcome
tracking) plus a synchronous `POST /me/test-dm` diagnostic route and
"Send test DM" button on the preferences page.

## Rejected

### Daily digest mode (rejected 2026-07-18)

Was: an opt-in "one morning DM listing everything due" to reduce
per-deadline ping fatigue for multi-subscription users. Rejected by the
owner during design review — not worth the scheduling complexity it
would have needed (a per-user local-morning gate layered onto
`due_reminders()`/`tick()`) for a noise problem the owner doesn't
consider significant enough to solve right now.
