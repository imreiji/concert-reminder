# WISHLIST.md

Every potential feature raised in roadmap and UX discussions, ordered by
user impact (highest first). Maintained per the "Feature wishlist" section
in CLAUDE.md: fully re-evaluated and re-ranked every time a feature ships.
Each entry notes impact and effort so re-ranking has a basis. Shipped and
rejected ideas move to the bottom sections instead of being deleted.

Full mobile parity (bottom tab bar, FAB, swipeable board, filter sheet,
bottom-sheet dialogs) shipped 2026-07-21 as a CSS/template retrofit, not a
Proposed entry here, so there is nothing to move to Shipped -- but the
revision pass below reconsiders every entry it touches.

## Proposed (highest impact first)


### 1. Minute-level reminder offsets

Impact: medium (raised from low) - effort: small. Raised: 2026-07-18
(domain-model review discussion). Re-ranked 2026-07-19.

`ReminderRule`/`PresetItem` already support `offset_days` + `offset_hours`
(0-23); there's no `offset_minutes`. The 60s scheduler tick already
delivers at ~1-minute granularity, so the gap is purely the data model +
form UI, not scheduling precision.

Re-ranked up because the condition the owner attached to it has now
fired: the entry said "revisit if/when FCFS-style rounds get their own
flag", and `RoundKind.FCFS_SALE` shipped on 2026-07-18. First-come-
first-served sales are exactly the case where "remind me 5 minutes before
it opens" beats "remind me 3 hours before", so this is no longer
speculative - it just has no user complaints behind it yet.

Reinforced, not re-ranked, by the 2026-07-20 onboarding build: the welcome
wizard's default-reminders step had to drop the demo's "30 minutes before"
fine-tune option for the same reason (`PresetItem` has no minutes column),
so the gap now visibly shows up in a second surface, not just FCFS sales.
Stays #1.

Re-reviewed 2026-07-20 (i18n build): whichever "N minutes before" copy this
eventually ships (fine-tune option labels, sentence-style rule descriptions)
will need both catalogues filled in alongside the schema/form work -- one
more small addition to effort, not a reason to re-rank.

### 2. Collapse a round's multiple "Coming up" rows into one

Impact: medium - effort: medium. Raised: 2026-07-19 (Home/Discover split,
branch review). Re-ranked 2026-07-19 (twice).

`upcoming_deadlines` emits one row per future anchor, so a single round
with opens/closes/results/payment ahead of it takes up to four of Home's
ten "Coming up" slots, all naming the same round. The correctness half of
this (each of those rows offering its own independent capture buttons,
including on a round nobody could have entered yet) was fixed on
2026-07-19 by gating capture on `DeadlineRow.can_capture`; what remains is
purely the row budget. Deferred rather than done because collapsing
changes the shape of the fragment that `POST /rounds/{id}/outcome` swaps
back in via htmx, and the no-buttons gate already removed the harm.

Kept at medium rather than raised, but it is now cheaper than it was: the
concert page's per-leg round rows (2026-07-19) already render one row per
ROUND with a single primary anchor chosen by `_primary_anchor`, so the
collapsed shape exists and has tests behind it. What remains is deciding
whether Home wants the same rule and re-pointing the htmx swap at it.

Nudged up one slot (from #3) by upgrade rounds shipping on 2026-07-19: an
upgrade round is one more anchor-bearing round per concert, so on a concert
with an upgrade the row budget is tighter still - though only for a viewer
eligible to enter it, since `my_deadline_rows` drops the upgrade's rows for
everyone else.

Reinforced, not re-ranked, by the 2026-07-21 mobile-view build: the phone
retrofit turned each "Coming up" row into a bordered card (padding, border,
margin-bottom) rather than a compact table row, so the same four-rows-per-
round budget now costs several screens of scroll on a phone instead of a
few pixels of table height on desktop. Still deferred for the same reason
as before (collapsing changes the htmx swap shape), but the phone case is
now the more visible motivator of the two.

### 3. Pin the Python version across dev, CI and the server

Impact: low (risk mitigation, not user-visible) - effort: small. Raised:
2026-07-21 (PR #57 CI failure post-mortem).

CI went red on the i18n branch with an `UnboundLocalError` that no local
run could reproduce: Ubuntu 24.04's system Python is CPython 3.12.3, whose
PEP 709 inlined comprehensions leak the iteration variable into the
enclosing scope's symbol table (fixed in later 3.12.x), while the dev
machine runs 3.13.1 where the same code is legal. Nothing pins a version
anywhere - no `.python-version`, no `python-version:` in `ci.yml` - so dev,
CI and the production server (also Ubuntu 24.04, so also 3.12.3-eligible)
can all resolve different interpreters, and `requires-python = ">=3.11"`
makes every one of them fair game. The immediate bug was fixed in code
(`f41b847` renames the throwaway `_` bindings), but the drift remains.

Fix is one file: a `.python-version` (e.g. `3.13`) at the repo root, which
`uv sync` honors everywhere. Deliberately NOT done as part of the CI fix
because it changes the production interpreter on the next deploy (uv would
download 3.13 to Lightsail and rebuild the venv) - that is an operational
call the owner should make consciously, ideally timed with a deploy he can
watch. Until then, any new code that behaves differently across 3.11-3.13
will only be caught if CI's particular interpreter happens to object.

### 4. Cache-bust static assets so deploys can't serve stale CSS

Impact: medium (every CSS-touching deploy is silently defaced until the
cache expires or someone purges) - effort: small. Raised: 2026-07-21
(i18n deploy: the live language switcher rendered completely unstyled).

`base.html` links `/static/style.css` with no version marker, and
Cloudflare caches it at the edge (`cf-cache-status: HIT`). The i18n deploy
shipped new templates against the OLD cached stylesheet: the language
switcher rendered as a naked `<details>` (visible marker, header reflow,
unstyled buttons) until a manual purge. Any future deploy that adds CSS
for new markup has the same window, and nothing in the deploy ritual
mentions purging.

Fix shape: version the asset URL so the cache key changes with the file -
e.g. a `static_url("style.css")` Jinja global appending `?v=<hash>` (hash
of file contents, computed once at startup), applied to `style.css` and
any future static asset the templates reference. Cloudflare then treats
each deploy's CSS as a fresh URL and the purge step disappears entirely.
Until this ships, the deploy runbook should at least say "purge Cloudflare
cache after any static/ change".

Reinforced, not re-ranked, by the 2026-07-21 mobile-view build: the phone
retrofit appended a large `@media (max-width: 700px)` section to
`style.css` in one commit -- exactly the shape of CSS-touching deploy this
entry warns about, and a wider blast radius than the language-switcher
incident that raised it (every phone visitor would see broken layout, not
one control). Manually purge Cloudflare after this deploys until the fix
ships.

### 5. PWA / installability

Impact: low-medium - effort: medium. Raised: 2026-07-21 (mobile-view
build).

The phone retrofit (tab bar, FAB, bottom sheets) makes the site read like
an app on a phone browser, but there is still no way to install it as one:
no manifest, no service worker, no "Add to Home Screen" affordance. A
manifest.json (name, icons, `display: standalone`, theme color matching
the token layer) plus a minimal service worker would let a phone user add
a real home-screen icon and launch into a browser-chrome-free window --
the natural next step after this build, not a prerequisite for it. Impact
stays low-medium rather than higher until it's paired with something a
plain browser tab can't do (push notifications would need this shipped
first, since web push requires a service worker; DM-notification parity
for phone users who don't want the Discord app open is the case that would
raise this). Effort is medium: the manifest and icons are small, but a
correct service worker (cache strategy, update flow, avoiding the classic
"stale offline shell" trap) is not.

### 6. Minor demo-parity cosmetics

Impact: low - effort: small. Raised: 2026-07-20 (demo-reconciliation
re-review).

Cosmetic gaps the 2026-07-20 reconciliation left unbatched because they are
pure polish, not correctness: Preferences' "Follow another tag" is a
disclosure fold rather than the demo's footer `.bar` + button, and its
second toggle reads "Auto-apply" where the demo says "Auto-apply preset";
the Tags edit dialog lists every member instead of the demo's "+N more"
truncation, and its new-tag dialog footer sits slightly detached (nested in
a grid rather than a sibling of the body); Setup's pick tiles are
keyboard-reachable now but use a visually-hidden checkbox where the demo
uses a real `<button aria-pressed>`, and `.lede h1` lacks `text-wrap:
balance`. The cheapest of the open items - one small pass closes all of it.

Re-reviewed 2026-07-20 (i18n build): every string this entry touches or adds
now needs both catalogues updated (`tests/test_i18n_catalogues.py` fails
otherwise), a small but real addition to "small" effort that didn't exist
when this was raised.

### 7. Discover sort in the content head, plus the catalogue-count note

Impact: low - effort: small. Raised: 2026-07-20 (demo-reconciliation
re-review).

The reconciliation gave Discover's sort and round-status controls the
demo's pill chrome but left them in the sidebar; the demo puts the sort
control in the content-column head. Also missing: the demo's per-filter
result note above the grid ("Love Live! - 64 concerts"). The page-level
catalogue count ("N concerts - M with a round still open") shipped in the
reconciliation, but not this filtered one. Deferred rather than done because
moving sort is a real DOM restructure and it is debatable whether the
sidebar is actually worse.

Re-reviewed 2026-07-20 (i18n build): the per-filter result note is new
user-visible copy with an embedded count, so whoever builds this owes both
catalogues an `ngettext`-shaped entry (singular/plural), not just an
English string, on top of the DOM work already scoped.

Re-reviewed 2026-07-21 (mobile-view build): the sidebar controls now also
render inside `.fsheet`, the phone filter sheet (`order: -1` above 760px,
a "Filters" summary/button below it, tracking `.layout`'s own 760px
collapse point) -- any future move of sort into the content head must
carry the fsheet's relocated copy along with it, not just the desktop
sidebar's, or the two surfaces drift.

### 8. Editor page parity with the demo

Impact: low - effort: medium. Raised: 2026-07-20 (demo-reconciliation
re-review).

The editor got no dedicated reconciliation task; the token pass fixed its
radius, chips and dark mode automatically and the consolidation swapped its
"Applies to"/"Qualifies" labels to `.eyebrow`. What remains is mostly the
demo's structure versus deliberate build choices rather than accidental
drift: the demo nests rounds inside each leg card, while shipped keeps flat
round and leg lists with chips (which is what lets a browser-added leg be
targeted before it has an id); the demo shows round name/kind and leg fields
as read-only summaries with Edit buttons, while shipped is always-open
inputs; plus minor add-button order and a "1 upgrade" tally count. Lowest
priority because a parity pass here would mostly re-litigate justified
decisions.

Re-reviewed 2026-07-20 (i18n build): the "1 upgrade" tally and any new
read-only summary copy are user-visible strings too -- same catalogue-update
cost as the two entries above, folded into this one's existing medium
effort rather than raising it.

(The former "Eventernote links on performer chips" entry was dropped in the
2026-07-19 revision pass: it already shipped inside the Tags page redesign,
which added `Tag.eventernote_url` and wired it onto the concert page's
performer chips - see its Shipped entry below.)

## Shipped

### Multi-language support (English / Mandarin / Japanese) (2026-07-20)

Shipped as: end-to-end i18n across web and Discord. gettext catalogues
(`messages.po`, ~704 msgids each) for ja and zh, compiled to `.mo` in memory
at startup -- no `.mo` on disk, no deploy-ritual change -- with `en` mapped
to `NullTranslations` so English stays byte-identical to the pre-i18n app
(existing render tests needed no changes beyond two legitimately-retargeted
ones). Locale resolution reuses the shape of the existing timezone
preference: a `lang` cookie caches `users.language` (never the source of
truth), `Accept-Language` covers first-ever visits, a public `POST
/language` is the single write path (cookie always, DB column when signed
in, since Discord DMs read the column not the cookie), and the OAuth
callback seeds the column from the cookie at account creation only. A 🌐
header switcher, a Preferences "Time & language" row, and a welcome-wizard
language step are the three surfaces that set it. All ~28 templates,
service-layer prose, and the Discord side (embeds, views, cogs, plus
per-recipient locale threaded through `DueReminder.user_language` /
`NoticeContext.user_language` / `LegCancelledContext.user_language`) are
gettext-wrapped; date formatting grew hand-built locale-aware ja/zh patterns
in `domain/timezones.py` layered on top of the existing dual JST/local
rendering (invariant 1 unchanged). UGC gained parallel translation columns
(`Concert.title_zh/notes_en/notes_zh/venue_en/venue_zh`, `Tag.name_en/
name_zh`, alongside the pre-existing `title_en`), a display-vs-identity
rule (read surfaces localize via `loc_field`/`loc`; search/edit/match stay
canonical), and an editor "Translations" fold -- two migrations, no
backfill. The legal pages got a full translation plus a non-EN-only
"English version governs" note. A hygiene test
(`tests/test_i18n_catalogues.py`) extracts every msgid in-process and fails
CI if either catalogue has an untranslated or fuzzy entry, whitelist
intentionally empty. The ja/zh strings themselves are a competent-bilingual,
machine-assisted translation pass, not a native-speaker-reviewed one --
flagged here for the owner to spot-check before treating any string as
final. Closes the "Multi-language support" entry the onboarding build
deliberately scoped out and logged on 2026-07-20.

### Onboarding and untouched-pages build (2026-07-20)

Shipped as: the last user-facing surfaces the reconciliation never covered,
built from the `dekimasen-onboarding-demo.html` concept, on the shipped design
system. The signed-out home became a real landing page (hero, value prop, a
"how it works", an illustrative campaign board, a live Discover taste with tag
chips, and a Sign-in CTA) while the signed-in board stayed unchanged. The
five-step `/welcome` wizard was rebuilt on the card/chip vocabulary and now
flows seamlessly into `/setup`: its default-reminders step is the settled
cards-plus-sentence-fine-tune design over all five anchors (Opens/Closes/
Results/Payment/Show; default reminds once for Opens/Results/Payment, Closes
gets a couple, nothing on Show), materialising a real `ReminderPreset` through a
single new `create_preset_from_rules` service helper (no second write path), and
the timezone step gained the browser-detection select reusing the existing
`tz_auto` routes. Import preview was rebuilt in the day-card/round-card/leg-chip
vocabulary with a Kind selector and an editable Details/links fold, and
`import_commit` now binds a round to several legs via the same `round_legs`/
`day_key`/`parse_round_legs` path as `create_concert` -- a multi-leg round at
import, which the old flat form could not express at all. Import form,
retroactive-apply, and the privacy/terms pages were reframed in the design
system (routes, SSRF guard, and legal wording unchanged). Review caught and
fixed an empty-default-preset bug (a wizard submit with no rules would have
created a default that never reminds -- now rejected 422 server-side and blocked
client-side). Real multi-language i18n was deliberately scoped out and logged as
its own Proposed entry. No schema change.

### Add-concert page refactor, incl. multi-leg rounds in one pass (2026-07-20)

Shipped as: `concert_new.html` rebuilt on the editor's card/fold/chip
language (identity-first - title, event id and the first performance open at
the top, details and tags folded, since creation must fill the required
spine before anything else), and - the correctness half - the create form's
round-to-leg binding migrated off the single `round_leg` `<select>` +
`resolve_round_leg` text-matcher onto the editor's leg chips. On the create
form every leg is id-less until save, exactly the case the chips' `day_key`
scheme was built for, so `create_concert` now mirrors `edit_concert`'s
post-flush `key_to_day_id` / `parse_round_legs` (and `parse_round_qualifiers`
for upgrade rounds) resolution, and a genuinely multi-leg round is
expressible in one pass instead of having to be created then edited. This is
the former "Let the creation form express a multi-leg round in one pass"
proposal, shipped - and it closed the same data-loss shape on the create
door that the editor redesign fixed on the edit door (the old select could
only ever store one leg). Retired the now-dead `resolve_round_leg` and
`_leg_picker_script.html` (create was their last caller). Invariants 1/3/6/7
intact; no schema change.

### Demo reconciliation: theming and view parity (2026-07-20)

Shipped as: the full design-token layer ported into `style.css` (the
`*-wash` set, `--raise`, `--chip`, `--shadow`, ...) plus dark mode via both
`prefers-color-scheme` (OS default) and a persisted `data-theme` header
toggle stamped before first paint (no flash); a two-line dual-time render
(`fmt_dual_lines`/the `dual_lines` Jinja global) replacing the flat
one-line web format, with `fmt_day_month`/`day_month` kept separate for
performance dates; and the per-view component gaps the six-branch UI/UX
refactor had dropped against the frozen concept demo -- Home's peek grid,
foot-note and board accents, the concert page's follow toggle and centered
performer chips, Discover's chip counts and tile minichips, Tags' dialog
shadow and button alignment, Setup's reveal-stat overflow fix, and a
rebuilt Preferences on the demo's vocabulary. Also closed the one gap that
was backend, not presentation: `POST /me/delete`, the self-serve GDPR
erasure the demo showed but shipped as a manual-request placeholder, now
wired to the existing `service.delete_user` behind a heavy confirmation.
No behavior changed outside the delete route and the theme toggle itself;
this was reconciliation against the demo, not new feature work.

### First-run capture flow (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: a three-screen `/setup` flow run AFTER the `/welcome` wizard —
`GET /setup` prunes the concerts a user's tag subscriptions imply (tiles lit
by default; switching one off writes a branch-4 `OPTED_OUT` override, and
re-checking a pruned one CLEARS the override back to the tag default rather
than writing an explicit subscribe), `GET /setup/applications` asks which
still-live rounds — open now, or closed and awaiting a result — the user
already applied to and records `APPLIED` through `record_round_outcome` only
(no second write path), and `GET /setup/ready` reveals the board tallies
(tracking / applied / payment due / next deadline). No new step state: every
screen renders current DB truth, which makes the flow tamper-safe (nothing
reads a step from user input) and re-runnable (Preferences' "Run first-time
setup again" points at `GET /setup`). `POST /welcome/advance` now redirects
into `/setup` when it crosses into done; `skip-all` still lands on `/`.
Backed by `db/service.py`'s `setup_prune_tiles` / `setup_application_rows` /
`setup_tallies` / `apply_prune_selection` / `record_setup_applications` and
the `_round_asks_application` predicate (carrying the documented branch-5
upgrade-round hook). Consumes branch 4's `ConcertSubscription` override model
and adds no schema of its own. Closes the six-branch UI/UX refactor.

### Upgrade rounds and their qualifying-round set (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: a new `RoundKind.UPGRADE` (label "Upgrade round", emoji) for the
Japanese upgrade round - a nested second campaign only holders of a
qualifying round's ticket may enter - modelled end to end. A named
association table `round_qualifiers(upgrade_round_id, qualifying_round_id)`
with both FKs ON DELETE CASCADE (modelled on `TagMember`) records which
rounds qualify; no qualifiers means "any secured (WON/PAID) ticket on this
concert qualifies", mirroring `applies_to`'s empty-means-all. A pure
`domain/upgrades.py:is_eligible` derives per-user eligibility from recorded
`RoundOutcome`s - never stored - and is threaded through the three existing
per-user seams, not the pure planner: `_apply_outcome_suppression` (the
upgrade is exempt from the secured-elsewhere suppression a base ticket would
trigger, then re-suppressed for ineligible users), `_next_round_for_leg` /
`_auto_arm_next_round` (an upgrade neither arms on a base loss nor arms
anything when itself lost), and `column_for` (a won upgrade's payment
outranks a secured base). Discover shows the campaign as its own accent pill
beside the base standing; Home's Coming up gates the upgrade row and its
`Entered upgrade` / `Skipping` capture on eligibility; the concert page shows
an ineligible viewer a `Requires a ticket from: ...` line instead of capture
buttons; the global anonymous deadline list is unchanged (the round's
existence is public). The editor gained a "Qualifies" toggle-chip row inside
an `.upgradebox`, shown only for an UPGRADE round, encoded exactly like the
branch-2 `round_legs` chips (one hidden `round_qualifiers` field per round
row, `parse_round_qualifiers` filtering to surviving round ids and dropping
self). Chips reference only already-saved rounds; a round created in the same
submit cannot be a qualifier until saved once, stated in the UI copy. No new
`RoundOutcome` write path (invariant 2 intact); one nullable-free migration
(the association table), no backfill.

### Tags page redesign, second pass (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: the Tags page rebuilt around counted chips (dashed when unused),
franchise->group->member families, region-bucketed venues with a "No region"
bucket, and a performers-with-no-group section; a per-tag edit dialog with a
usage strip (concerts/followers/members/upcoming) and a per-member
"apply to N upcoming concerts" action reusing the shipped retroactive-apply
route (invariant 3 intact); a kind-conditional new-tag dialog that warns
instead of blocking on a same-name/different-kind tag (`create_tag` drops its
blanket 409 for a kind-scoped one). Adds `Tag.eventernote_url` (mirroring
venue `location_url`, through `form_url`) and wires it onto the concert
page's performer chips, closing the link the branch-2 concert page deferred.
Follow-up noted: the tag directory's per-member eligible-concerts count is an
N+1, immaterial at current scale.

### Concert subscriptions and per-leg opt-out (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: `ConcertSubscription` (state `subscribed`/`opted_out`) and
`LegOptOut`, both OVERRIDE tables -- no row means follow the tag-derived
default, so no backfill (invariant 8). `tracked_concert_ids` now applies
the override; per-leg opt-out folds into `_apply_outcome_suppression`;
writes re-sync via `reinstate_user_rules`. The concert page's Following
toggle and per-leg opt-out, Home's real "skip this concert", and a
rebuilt Preferences (left rail, a Following section with the pruned count
and restore) all became real instead of placeholders. Prunes stick across
re-follow; opting out of a won ticket needs a heavy confirmation and never
deletes the outcome.

### Concert page and editor redesign (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: two surfaces rebuilt around the same fact, that a round belongs
to a set of LEGS. The concert page (`templates/concert_detail.html` +
`_round_rows.html`) now leads with lineage and performers rather than a
metadata header, and replaces the single rounds table with one round-row
group per leg plus an all-legs group, grouped by `service.concert_round_rows`
(cancelled legs included, a round covering every live leg deliberately
landing in the all-legs group rather than being repeated under each). Rounds
on that page carry capture buttons via the `_capture_actions.html` macro
shared with Home's rows, so `POST /rounds/{id}/outcome` now answers two
surfaces - it reads which one from `HX-Current-URL` and sends the concert
page its own rounds region instead of Home's three fragments.

The editor (`templates/concert_edit.html`) puts rounds first, folds the rest,
turns cancelled into a per-leg toggle, and moves duplicate/delete into a
danger row that states what duplicate copies (invariant 3: the pruned tag
set, `expand=False`, no rounds or legs).

The data-loss fix underneath: the editor used to express `applies_to` as one
free-text string per round, matched server-side against each day's city or
label, and pre-filled that box from `applies_to[0]` alone - so opening a
two-leg round and saving it untouched silently narrowed it to one leg. Legs
are now toggle chips submitting real ids, encoded as ONE `round_legs` field
per round row (a flat repeated field could not say which row an id belonged
to). A leg added in the same save has no id yet, so its chip carries the
row's client-generated `day_key`, resolved after the flush.

Branch review on 2026-07-19 then closed a second, larger copy of the same
bug before merge: `round_legs` was end-padded unconditionally, so a browser
still holding the pre-deploy edit page - which posts the old `round_leg`
field and no `round_legs` at all - would have had one Save wipe `applies_to`
on every round of the concert. A whole-array omission now preserves each
round's existing legs; a partial array raises rather than sliding every
later row's selection by one.

### Web-side won/lost for a round with nothing left ahead of it (2026-07-19)

Was proposed on 2026-07-19 (Home/Discover split review) and shipped the same
day by the concert page above, which took the first of the two options it
named: a capture surface on the concert page itself, rather than a grace
window on Home.

The gap was that capture lived only on Home's "Coming up" rows, and a row
exists only while the round has a FUTURE anchor - so a round whose results
had passed with no payment deadline behind it dropped off Home entirely,
stranding anyone sitting on APPLIED with no web-side way to say how it went.
The concert page lists EVERY round of the concert regardless of timing and
runs the same `capture_gates`, so `can_report_result` is true there exactly
when it should be. Nothing was relaxed in `record_round_outcome` to get it
(the gates stay on the read side), and no second write path was added.

### Home and Discover split (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: the old combined index page cut in two by the question each
answers. `/` (`templates/home.html`, handler in `web/app.py`) is Home -
personal, login-gated, four blocks: Up next, the four-column campaign board
(`domain/board.py`'s `column_for` plus `service.board_cards`), Coming up
(`service.my_deadline_rows`, the page's only capture surface), and a teaser
out to Discover. `/discover` (`web/routes/discover.py` +
`templates/discover.html`) is the catalogue - and is public, the only
content page an anonymous visitor can reach - with a round-status facet, a
next-deadline sort, and one merged status pill per card
(`service.discover_statuses`). Capture actions post to
`web/routes/outcomes.py`, which shares `record_round_outcome` with the DM
buttons and swaps three fragments back (the rows, plus the board and its
tally out-of-band).

Branch review on 2026-07-19 then fixed six things before merge: the top
block claimed "Closes next" while showing an open (now "Up next", honest
about which moment it names); every future anchor of one round offered its
own capture buttons, so a user could record APPLIED against a round that
had not opened (now gated on `can_capture`); WON and LOST existed only as
Discord buttons, leaving a `dm_blocked` user or a `bot_enabled=False`
deploy with a four-column board the web could only drive two columns of
(now offered on an APPLIED row once its result moment lands); the teaser
counted every Concert row rather than what `/discover` lists;
`tracked_concert_ids` ran twice per render; and the docs were behind.

### Public terms of service page (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: `GET /terms`, the counterpart to `/privacy` — same shape
(`web/routes/terms.py` + `templates/terms.html`, `current_user` not
`require_user` so Discord's reviewers can read it signed out), filling the
Terms of Service URL field the Developer Portal offers alongside the
Privacy Policy URL. The clause that actually matters is the disclaimer of
warranty: the service tracks real ticketing deadlines and cannot promise a
DM arrives, arrives on time, or that the date is right, so it says so
plainly and puts confirmation with the official source on the user. Also
covers non-affiliation (the app is entirely about other people's events),
Discord's own minimum age rather than a number, acceptable use, editor
contributions staying in the shared catalogue after erasure (matching the
privacy policy and `delete_user`), availability/shutdown, and New Brunswick
governing law. Contacts reuse the existing `PRIVACY_CONTACT_*` settings via
a new shared `web/contact.py`; the two pages cross-link.

### Public privacy policy page (2026-07-19)

Shipped as: `GET /privacy`, a public (deliberately no `require_user`)
long-form policy page in `web/routes/privacy.py` + `templates/privacy.html`,
linked from the `base.html` footer. Required by Discord's Developer Terms
for any app collecting user data, and mandatory at bot verification /
100+ guilds; also covers the GDPR transparency obligation. Content is
written against the actual schema rather than boilerplate, and documents
the erasure semantics the `1384cadd692e` migration enables (personal data
deleted, contributed catalogue kept with the author anonymised). The
operator's contact handle and email come from two new blank-by-default
settings (`PRIVACY_CONTACT_DISCORD` / `PRIVACY_CONTACT_EMAIL`) so real
contact details never enter the repo; the page renders with both, one, or
neither configured.

### First-run guided setup (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a `/welcome` wizard route that sequences new logins through
tag subscriptions (follow artists), default reminder preset selection,
timezone confirmation, a test DM to verify delivery, and calendar feed
subscription. Backed by an `onboarding_step` column on `User` to track
progress, a new-user redirect in the OAuth callback, and a `next`
redirect parameter added to the five existing routes the wizard reuses
(concerts, presets, tags, preferences, calendar) to stitch them together
into one seamless flow.

### Corrected and expanded round-kind taxonomy (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: two new `RoundKind` enum values, `FCFS_SALE` and `TOUR_PACKAGE`,
splitting out first-come-first-served sales from the previously-conflated
general-sale kind and adding support for overseas tour package sales. A
centralized `LABEL_BY_ROUND_KIND` dict in `db/service.py` now provides
display labels for all nine kinds (replacing six inline label derivations
scattered across templates), with corrected emoji assignments (removing
the racing emoji misapplied to `GENERAL_SALE`, adding the appropriate
emoji for the two new kinds). Also updated `ingest.py`'s ramen.events
keyword table to recognize FCFS and tour-package keywords in HTML parsing.

### Per-round personal lottery outcome tracking (applied / won / lost / paid) (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: state-aware DM buttons (Applied/Not applied, Won/Lost, Paid)
on the reminder embed, backed by a new `RoundOutcome` table and
`record_round_outcome`/`_apply_outcome_suppression` in `db/service.py` —
losing suppresses that round's payment reminder and arms the next
round's opens reminder; winning skips the general-sale ping. Also
generalized `snooze_reminder` to accept a `days` parameter and added a
"Remind me later" modal-driven button (replacing the plain 24h snooze)
on the CLOSES-anchor reminder specifically, plus relabeled that anchor's
link button to "Apply here".

### Free-text search matches artists, groups, and venues (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a centralized `concert_search_text` helper (`web/app.py`) that
is now the single source of truth for what search matches — title,
title_en, every attached tag's name across all four kinds
(franchise/group/artist/venue), and a free-text `Concert.venue` fallback
only when no VENUE tag is attached. Used at all three call sites: the
server-side `matches_query` fallback, the tile grid's `data-search`
attribute, and the "Coming up soon" deadline list's `data-search`
attribute (previously title-only).

### Surface undeliverable DMs to the user (2026-07-18)

Shipped as: a sitewide `dm_blocked` banner (driven by `SessionUser` /
`users.dm_blocked_since`, set by the scheduler's delivery-outcome
tracking) plus a synchronous `POST /me/test-dm` diagnostic route and
"Send test DM" button on the preferences page.

## Rejected

### Daily digest mode (rejected 2026-07-18)

Was: an opt-in "one morning DM listing everything due" to reduce
per-deadline ping fatigue for multi-subscription users. Rejected by the
owner during design review — not worth the scheduling complexity it
would have needed (a per-user local-morning gate layered onto
`due_reminders()`/`tick()`) for a noise problem the owner doesn't
consider significant enough to solve right now.
